/*--------------------------------------------------------------
All styling is handled via Vite compilation and WordPress enqueuing.

Compiled styles are automatically loaded based on development/production mode:
- Development: http://localhost:5173/assets/src/scss/style.scss (hot reload)
- Production: /assets/dist/css/style-[hash].css (optimized build)

Style source files:
- assets/src/scss/style.scss (main entry point)
- assets/src/scss/_variables.scss (CSS custom properties)
- assets/src/scss/_mixins.scss (SCSS mixins and functions)
- assets/src/scss/_main-styles.scss (all custom theme styles)

Library styles included:
- lightgallery.min.css (image gallery functionality)
- nouislider.min.css (range slider component)
- swiper-bundle.min.css (carousel/slider component)

No styles should be added to this file. All customizations should be made
in the SCSS source files and compiled via npm run build.
